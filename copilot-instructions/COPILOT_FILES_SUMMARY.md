## üí° Pro Tips for Using with Copilot

### Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Specific**
   ```
   First: "Read 00_START_HERE.md and 01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md"
   Then: "Now read 02_BACKEND_SETUP.md and create server.js"
   ```

2. **Reference Files Explicitly**
   ```
   "Following 05_NAVBAR_COMPONENT.md, create the NavBar component with mobile menu"
   ```

3. **Use the Styling Guide**
   ```
   "Using colors from 08_STYLING_GUIDE.md, style this button as a primary CTA"
   ```

4. **Follow the Implementation Order**
   ```
   "Following Phase 2 in 09_IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md, create the authentication endpoint"
   ```

### Sample Prompts for Copilot

**Starting the backend:**
```
I have read 02_BACKEND_SETUP.md. Please create server.js with all the requirements 
listed, including authentication, quote, application, inventory, order, and settings 
endpoints. Use port 5001 and the exact error handling patterns shown.
```

**Building App.js:**
```
Following 04_APP_STRUCTURE.md, create the main App.js file with routing state 
management. Include all components listed in order: NavBar, HeroSection, 
ServicesSection, ProductsSection, QuoteForm, AboutSection, CareersSection, Footer, 
LoginPage, and AdminPanel with all modules.
```

**Styling a component:**
```
Using the exact colors from 08_STYLING_GUIDE.md (Navy Blue #0a2a52 and Orange-Red 
#e84424), style this form with proper focus states and button hover effects.
```

## üö® Common Copilot Mistakes to Watch For

### Mistake 1: Wrong Colors
‚ùå Copilot uses: `bg-blue-900` or `bg-orange-500`
‚úÖ Correct: `bg-[#0a2a52]` and `bg-[#e84424]`
**Fix:** Remind Copilot to use exact hex codes from 08_STYLING_GUIDE.md

### Mistake 2: Wrong Port
‚ùå Copilot uses: Port 5000 or 3001
‚úÖ Correct: Port 5001 for backend
**Fix:** Reference 02_BACKEND_SETUP.md for correct port

### Mistake 3: Multiple Files
‚ùå Copilot creates separate component files
‚úÖ Correct: All components in src/App.js
**Fix:** Reference 04_APP_STRUCTURE.md - single file requirement

### Mistake 4: Class Components
‚ùå Copilot creates: `class NavBar extends React.Component`
‚úÖ Correct: `function NavBar({ props })`
**Fix:** Remind about functional components only

### Mistake 5: Wrong API URL
‚ùå Copilot uses: `http://localhost:3000/api`
‚úÖ Correct: `http://localhost:5001/api`
**Fix:** Reference API_BASE constant in 04_APP_STRUCTURE.md
